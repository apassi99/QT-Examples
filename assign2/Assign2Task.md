You are to submit a zip file of a single directory, where the directory is called assign2 and the zip file is assign2.zip.  I have attached a zip file that contains the files that your directory must have -- these files must be in the zip file that you submit.  In addition to those files, you should include a unit test that you have constructed for the andGate class defined in andgate.h.  No other files should be included.

The definition of the assignment is given in main.cpp and andgate.h in the attached zip file.  An example input file along with the expected output of your program for that input file is in the attached zip file.  Start by using the project file (*.pro) that I have included.  You should read those before reading further here.

To receive a score of more than 0, you must do all of the following:
(1) Do not modify or add to the public methods defined in andgate.h -- you should, of course, implement those methods in andgate.cpp but do not define any new public methods or change the arguments or return values of the public methods that are defined in andgate.h.  The only additions you may make to andgate.h are adding private class member variables.
(2) Your program must behave as described in main.cpp.  
(3) You must use the QList container as specified in main.cpp
(4) You must have a unit test that appropriately tests all of the methods in the andGate class.  This should not be something that you write last or as an afterthought.  Write it as you implement the methods in andGate.
(5) Your program must accept an input file similar to the one provided in assign2.zip and should produce the expected output.
(6) You must use variable names that are descriptive as per the style guidelines.

If you have met those requirements, you will receive 40 out of 60 points.  The remaining 20 points will be assigned based on:
(1) (10 points) the quality of your implementation with a particular focus on whether you have well-designed, well-implemented code that takes advantage of Qt.
(2) (10 points) whether your implementation of the andGate class works with my main.cpp.  You will not have seen my main.cpp file, but if you have correctly implemented the andGate class, then it will work with my main.cpp program.
